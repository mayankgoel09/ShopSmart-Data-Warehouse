# 🏗️ ShopSmart Data Warehouse Project

## 📌 Project Overview

The **ShopSmart Data Warehouse Project** is an end-to-end SQL Server data warehousing solution designed to transform raw CRM and ERP datasets into analytics-ready business data. Following the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**, the project demonstrates how to build a scalable ETL pipeline that supports business intelligence and reporting.

The solution automates data ingestion, cleansing, transformation, and dimensional modeling, producing a robust **Star Schema** optimized for analytical queries and dashboard development.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Build a scalable SQL Data Warehouse from scratch.
* Automate ETL processes using SQL Server stored procedures.
* Integrate CRM and ERP datasets into a unified data model.
* Clean, validate, and standardize raw business data.
* Design a Star Schema for efficient analytical reporting.
* Generate business-ready views for downstream BI tools such as Power BI and Tableau.

# 🏛️ Data Warehouse Architecture

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture**, separating data into three logical layers.

## 🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw Data Ingestion

The Bronze layer acts as the landing zone for source data.

**Key Features**

* Imports CRM and ERP CSV files using **BULK INSERT**
* Preserves raw source data without transformation
* Stores data in staging tables
* Automates ingestion using the `bronze.load_bronze` stored procedure
* Synchronizes files and database using the **BCP (Bulk Copy Program)** utility

---

## 🥈 Silver Layer – Data Cleansing & Transformation

The Silver layer transforms raw data into reliable, standardized datasets.

**Transformations Performed**

* Data validation
* Duplicate removal
* Missing value handling
* Data normalization
* Standardization of formats
* Business rule implementation
* Integration of CRM and ERP datasets
* Preparation of clean datasets for analytics

The entire transformation pipeline is automated using the `silver.load_silver` stored procedure.

## 🥇 Gold Layer – Business Intelligence & Analytics

The Gold layer presents curated, analytics-ready data using a **Star Schema**.

### Dimension Views

* `gold.dim_customers`
* `gold.dim_products`

### Fact Views

* `gold.fact_sales`

These views consolidate data across multiple source systems, providing a clean and optimized structure for reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics.
